         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </gap>; let me ſee my Errata's, and I ſhall endeavor to correct and amind them.</p>
            <p>My Antagoniſt takes great exceptions at a plain-dealing Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:117533:3"/>intended only for himſelf and ſome few Friends, for I had no thoughts of printing then, and is conceited that I have exceedingly wronged him in it; all the right I can do him, is, not to inſert it here, and (though I am able to make good every jot and tittle of it) for the future to bury it in the abiſs of Oblivion, if ſo be I am not enforced by his unjuſt clamours, and exotick conſtructions put upon it, to ſend it, With a large Comment upon it, after this.</p>
            <p>All the exceptions he makes (ſo far forth as I can learn either from himſelf or others) againſt the particulars of my Anſwer, are ſo frivolous and groundleſs, that he durſt not give them under his own hand, much leſs publiſh them to the World, and therefore I may very well paſs them by; but yet I muſt needs vindicate the laſt particular (in the cloſe of all,) againſt which he hath draws up a Charge of high Crimis and Miſdemeanors: Good Friends and Readers turn to it; is begins thus, That <hi>I ſhould ſuper-abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly wrong him, if I ſhould not rank him amongſt the vileſt in the Kingdom, for with them, &amp;c.</hi> for this I muſt pay <hi>dearly,</hi> ſaith he, and his prophane fellow Members: But were not I a mad man, and might I not deſervedly incur the name or title of a <hi>Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick,</hi> ſhould I make a breach in his Church, in his Communion? and for this he calls me twenty Fools, and mad man, &amp;c. But work, a while, and you ſhall ſee the Food, the mad man, as well as the Whet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone, Will fall to his ſhare. He would perſwade people (or ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers for him) that there in that place I make him a <hi>Drunkard,</hi> a <hi>Thief,</hi> a <hi>Murderer,</hi> &amp;c. and why may be not as well perſwade them I make him a <hi>Whore?</hi> The buſineſs is in deed and in truth thus; All that are in Church-fellowſhip or Communion With him, are, in a Scripture ſence, his Brethren and Siſters. And this I dare ſay, I can prove againſt all the devils in hell by almoſt (if not all out or above) an hundred Scriptures: No man that hath not a fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head of Braſs or Iron can deny it. I have beſide the Scripture Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and the conſent of moſt Divines, whether Epiſcopal, Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Independent, or by what nick-names ſoever they are called or diſtinguiſhed, on my ſide; if any ſhall deny it, they muſt diſclaim their own principles or tenets. The very Book of Common-Prayer called all the men in all Pariſhes throughout <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Wales, Dearly beloved Brethren,</hi> &amp;c.

And that he came in again, is no where to be found neither can it be proved; therefore he eat not ſo much as of the Paſſeover, but only the common Supper, much leſs received the Sacrament.</p>
            <p>The reaſon why Mr <hi>Lightfeor</hi> hath gone againſt ſo manifeſt Light of Truth, the whole current or ſtream of orthodox, godly and learned Expoſitors, common ſence, &amp;c. is to me as clear as the Sun at noon days; and 'tis thus: He thought, if ever he proved <hi>Indas</hi> received the Sacrament, he muſt firſt prove the ſop was given two days before at <hi>Bethany,</hi> (which could he prove, would help his cauſe little or nothing,) and becauſe thoſe Scriptures that do indeed mention the Supper, <hi>viz. Matth.</hi> 26. <hi>Mark</hi> 14. <hi>John</hi> 12. would not ſerve ſuch a malignant deſign he wickedly, and ('tis to be feared) contra-conſcientiouſly wreſts and wrings in <hi>John</hi> 13. a place, ſo far from proof of his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that who ſo hath but half an eye, may eaſily ſee it never toucheth it. The man hath not yet perfectly learned
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:117533:7"/>the trade of wreſting and abuſing Scriptures (ſubtilly) for the the advancement of his Maſters Kingdom.</p>
            <p>Thus the very foundation on which he builds, being found no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>totiouſly falſe, and rotten, and utterly raſed, I might very well break off here; but I ſhall beſtow a little pains in viewing his reaſons alledged for father confirmation of his proundleſs aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p n="1">I. It is probable (ſaith he) nor can be conceived that <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi> ſhould receive the ſop, and ſo the D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. 'Tis probable all this might be done in one night; for <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi> was not ſo far from the high Prieſt, the band of men not ſo far to ſeek, (ſee <hi>Diodat</hi> on <hi>Iohn</hi> 18.3.) the Devil, <hi>Indas,</hi> and the Jews not ſo backward in driving on this damnable deſign, as be would inſinuate, I my ſelf have known in this betraying age five times more than this amounts unto brought about in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

            <p n="2">2. He (following the old trade) moſt ſhamefully abuſeth <hi>Mat</hi> 26.16. <hi>Mark</hi> 14 11. when he ſaith 'tis plain from thoſe Texts, That from the tune of the receiving the ſop <hi>Judas</hi> ſought opportunity to betray Chriſt: Read the Verſes before and after and then tell me it you can ſee but the print or footſters of any ſuch thing. Is it not plain in thoſe places, that from that time Chriſt reproved <hi>Indas</hi> for his coverous indignation at the ſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the ointment, he ſought opportunity, and from that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof took occaſion to betray him? 'Tis evident he ſought how
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:117533:7"/>he might conveniently betray Chriſt before he received the ſop. But,</p>
            <p n="3">3. A man may properly be ſaid to ſeek opportunity or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency to do that which he yet doth the ſame night. Now let any one of common capacity (even Mr <hi>Lightfoot</hi> himſelf) judg in this caſe.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Is is plain (ſaith he) that <hi>Indas</hi> began his treaſon at <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thany, Mat.</hi> 26.14. <hi>Mark</hi> 14.10.</p>

            <p>Be it ſo; but did he receive the ſop there?

            <p n="3">III. The Devil (ſaith he) entred into <hi>Indas</hi> at <hi>Bethany, Luk</hi> 22.3. and Verſ. 7. then came the Feaſt: and all the Evangeliſts ſet the treaſon conſpiracy before the feaſt of the Paſſeover.</p>

            <p n="1">1. <hi>Luke</hi> 22.3. ſpeaks nothing at all of the Supper at <hi>Bethony,</hi> nor of any thing done there.</p>

            <p>1. <hi>Iudas</hi> had not continued with him in his temptation. Neither,</p>
            <p>2. Could Chriſt appoint to him any other Kingdom, but that of wrath and darkneſs. Nor,</p>
            <p>3. Was he ever like to ſit at Chriſts table in his Kingdom; much leſs ſit on a throne in the judgment of the twelve tribes, who is himſelf to be judged as a devil.</p>
            <p>4. <hi>Math.</hi> 26.31. <hi>All ye ſhall be offended becauſe of me this night.</hi> This is the ſame <hi>All</hi> to whom the Sacrament was deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered. Let Mr <hi>Lightfoot</hi> take heed how he traduce Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, by affirming <hi>Iudas</hi> was one of that <hi>All</hi> he adminiſtred the ſeal and ſpake theſe words to. And let him not think to evade any of theſe Scriptures by ſaying <hi>Iudas</hi> has received the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and was gone forth, unleſs he be able to prove it.</p>
            <p>Mr <hi>Lightfoot.</hi> I cannot conceive how any ſhadow can be to gainſay his receiving.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> He doth well to blame the dulneſs of his own concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The cauſe he ſeeth not, is that darkneſs which dwells in him.</p>
            <p>Mr <hi>Lightfoot.</hi> —onely to vapor out another buſineſs—</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> The buſineſs he meaneth depends not upon <hi>Judas</hi> his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving or not receiving; and that he, and others, may beleeve it doth not, I will here grant that <hi>Judas</hi> did receive the Sacrament, now let Mr <hi>Lightfoot</hi> do his worſt.</p>
            <p>Mr <hi>Lightfoot.</hi> —which will be as ſoon blown over as this.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> I beleeve him; for this buſineſs is not yet blown over. He that doth it, muſt have a ſtronger breath then Mr <hi>Po<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>Mr <hi>Lightfoot.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the fancy is to make a noiſe of only the Saints receiving—</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hear O Heavens, and give ear O Earth, how reproachfully the man calls that a fancy all the Scriptures bear witneſs to the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:117533:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>moſt precious truth. Come, let us reaſon together a little, Mr <hi>Lightfoot:</hi> Do you beleeve there is a Communion of Saints? If ſo, how dare you call it a fancy? If you know no ſuch Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, (but Oh that you knew it, or rather were known of God in it) may I not juſtly number you amongſt thoſe <hi>Iu<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="2 letters">

Is your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of <hi>Chriſt</hi> and <hi>Belial,</hi> light and darkneſs, precious and vile, Saints and Devils? <hi>Can two walk, together, except they be agreed?</hi> (<hi>Amos</hi> 3.3.) And do you think there will ever be any concord or agreement between theſe? Why would you have the dirt and filth of the Nation bound up in the ſame bundle with the precious Sons of <hi>Sion?</hi> Why will you not allow Ieſus Chriſt the moſt precious materials living ſtones, to build him a houſe, a temple withall? Come, deal faithfully with your own ſoul, and tell me whether the Communion of Saints be a fancy or not and give me leave to open my heart as freely to you, and in ſo doing tell you, that I am afraid your Fellowſhip is in and with Darkneſs; but aſſure your ſelf the light will finde you out at length, if not to your converſion (but oh that it might be to that) yet to your utter ſhame and confuſion of face, in the preſence of thoſe Saints you dayly reproach and wound, yea, and Chriſt through their ſides. Oh that I could hear you ſay, this expreſſion dropt from your pen before you were aware of it, and that in truth not in hypocriſie; or that you would ſmite upon your thigh, and ſay, What have I done?</p>
            <p>Mr <hi>Lightfoot.</hi> Which if we could prove, then we might ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther particular Churches.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So then by his own confeſſion, if we can but prove none but Saints (i.e. ſuch as have upon them viſible or external ſanctity) ſhould receive the Sacrament, we may lawfully gather together into a particular (he means Independent) Congregation. Will the man ſtand to this think you? I fear, not. If he will, I dare ſay that ſhall hereafter be proved an <hi>abundanti,</hi> both from the Scriptures, the conſtitution and practice of the primitive Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, the Confeſſions of Faith of the moſt Churches in Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and the univerſal conſent of ſuch godly Divines both an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient and modern, as he himſelf durſt not but judg ſound and orthodox. And the lawfulneſs of gathering particular Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations (though I am not gathering any) I ſhall defend againſt

            <p>Mr <hi>Lightfoot.</hi> Which by ſteps would ſet us in ſuch an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to the wicked—</p>

            <p n="2">2. To that of <hi>Muncer,</hi> and his holy crew, I anſwer, as I may not take upon me to juſtifie the actions, beginnings and endings of all men of this or that form of worſhip; ſo it becomes not Mr <hi>Lightfoot</hi> (did he rightly underſtand himſelf) to judg of this or that form or way, by the carriage of, or Gods dealing with the corrupter ſort that profeſs it: For at that rate of judging what would become of Chriſtian Religion, ſet on foot by Chriſt and the twelve, amongſt whom there was one Devil?

If ſo, I preſume I ſhall find him work enough.
